[ ] Work on doing something about that Pixel data and pulling it out of game logic
    - maybe we have logical pixels, and raster pixel.
    - or maybe we just ditch the idea of pixel and say 1px = 1unit so we can 'measure' pacman
    - By doing this we save all the actual pixel stuff for rendering which is where it belongs
[ ] Start using png for stuff
