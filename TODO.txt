[x] use a match statement for piston events
  [x] move render stuff into own fn
  [x] move input stuff into own fn
  [x] move update stuff into own fn
[ ] Sort out `render` section of code. We want to render once per frame.
[ ] switch to SDL2 and draw to canvas
[ ] sort separate world coords from render to make things more natural
[ ] PixelPosition is useful for _this_ game put it back in
[ ] The issue is more about splitting out the rendering code and cleaning that up.
[ ] fix this wonky position thing where coords are in the corner... it's annoying to deal with
[ ] Work on doing something about that Pixel data and pulling it out of game logic
    - maybe we have logical pixels, and raster pixel.
    - or maybe we just ditch the idea of pixel and say 1px = 1unit so we can 'measure' pacman
    - By doing this we save all the actual pixel stuff for rendering which is where it belongs
[ ] Start using png for stuff
[ ] play sounds while game loop runs
[ ] RENDERING: the window size shouldn't depend on the board size. fix it.
[ ] AUDIO: audio cb should stop playing once oudio finishes
